# PelotonLivDiskLights
Autumn 2021 project to provide 10 sets of wearable lights for Peloton Liverpool Joy Ride winter cycling events (e.g. https://youtu.be/Y08svOdIMxA). It uses the [MCQN My Bike's Got LED board](github.com/mcqn/my-bikes-got-led) which was originally designed for [lights attached to bike frames](https://mcqn.com/posts/week-842-all-about-active-travel/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) but is equally good for most situations involving battery powered addressable LEDs

The lights consist of large circular disks on the front and back of each cyclist, attached with webbing straps. Each contains a disk of 93 addressable LEDs. The board and battery (4 x 18650) are in a waterproof(ish) pouch which is attached to the back of the front disk. Leads go from the board to the lights through holes in the back of the disks. These are taped over with plumbing tape to increase water resistance. The leads to the back disk are attached to one of the shoulder straps.
