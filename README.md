# PelotonLivDiskLights
Autumn 2021 project to provide 10 sets of wearable lights for Peloton Liverpool Joy Ride winter cycling events (e.g. https://youtu.be/Y08svOdIMxA). It uses the [MCQN My Bike's Got LED board](github.com/mcqn/my-bikes-got-led) which was originally designed for lights attached to bike frames but is equally good for most situations involving battery powered addressable LEDs.
