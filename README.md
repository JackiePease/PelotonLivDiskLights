# PelotonLivDiskLights
Autumn 2021 project to provide 10 sets of wearable lights for Peloton Liverpool Joy Ride winter cycling events (e.g. https://youtu.be/Y08svOdIMxA) produced by a group of volunteers from DoES Liverpool and Peloton Liverpool. It uses the [MCQN My Bike's Got LED board](github.com/mcqn/my-bikes-got-led) which was originally designed by Adrian McEwen for [lights attached to bike frames](https://mcqn.com/posts/week-842-all-about-active-travel/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) but is equally good for most situations involving battery powered addressable LEDs.

The lights consist of large circular disks on the front and back of each cyclist, attached with webbing straps. Each contains a disk of 93 addressable LEDs. The board and battery (4 x 18650) are in a waterproof(ish) pouch which is taped to the back of the front disk with VHB tape. Leads go from the board to the lights through holes in the back of the disks. These are taped over with plumbing tape to increase water resistance. The leads to the back disk are attached to one of the shoulder straps.

I started prototyping based on the children's backpacks shown on pages 10 and 11 of [this document](http://torquetorque.net/wp-content/uploads/CriticalKitsAndHow%20WeUseThem.pdf) as these had been donated to DoES Liverpool. I quickly found that the combination of electrical leads and cross over straps made them very confusing to put on and ended up using separate straps for each shoulder and both sides of the body. I was able to reuse the webbing and clips from this project though, as well as some leftover hook and loop tape and marking tape from a visor project.
